# Week 2 

## Week 2 Projects

This repository contains two projects created during Week 2:

### 1. Personal Website

The personal website showcases my portfolio, projects, and provides a brief introduction about myself. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed to be responsive for a seamless user experience.

### 2. Responsive YouTube Website

The responsive YouTube website mimics the interface of YouTube and features a homepage with recommended videos and search functionality. It adapts to various screen sizes to ensure optimal viewing.

Both projects are developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Feel free to explore the code and use them as a reference for your own projects.
