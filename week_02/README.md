# Week 2 

## Week 2 Projects

This repository contains two projects created during Week 2:

### 1. Personal Website

The personal website showcases my portfolio, and projects, and provides a brief introduction about myself. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed to be responsive for a seamless user experience.

### 2. Responsive youtube Website

The responsive youtube website mimics the interface of Youtube . It adapts to various screen sizes to ensure optimal viewing.

> Both projects are developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Feel free to explore the code and use them as a reference for your own projects.
